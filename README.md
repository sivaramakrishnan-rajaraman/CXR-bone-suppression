# Chest X-ray bone suppression toward improving classification and detection of Tuberculosis-consistent findings

Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most commonly performed diagnostic examination to detect lung-related abnormalities and other complications related to these conditions. However, its use to detect subtle abnormalities is constrained by the presence of bony structures including the ribs and clavicles that obscure these abnormalities and render them undetected. This study aims to build deep learning (DL)-based bone-suppression model that identifies and removes the superimposing bony structures in CXRs to facilitate reducing errors in radiological interpretation related to detecting Tuberculosis (TB)-consistent findings.

We propose a stagewise, systematic methodology in this study: First, we retrain an ImageNet-trained VGG-16 model on a large-scale, diverse, combined selection of publicly available CXRs to help it learn CXR modality-specific features. The learned knowledge is transferred to improve performance in a related target classification task of classifying CXRs in the publicly available Montgomery TB collection as showing normal lungs or pulmonary TB manifestations. Next, we train several bone-suppression models with varying architecture on the Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT) CXR dataset and its bone-suppressed counterpart. The performance of the trained models is tested using the cross-institutional National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical center (CC) dual-energy subtraction (DES) CXR dataset. The best-performing model is used to suppress bones in the Montgomery TB collection. We then compare the performance of the CXR-retrained VGG-16 models trained with the non-bone-suppressed and bone-suppressed Montgomery TB datasets using several performance metrics and analyzed them for a statistically significant difference. The predictions of the non-bone-suppressed and bone-suppressed models are interpreted through class-selective relevance maps (CRM).

Compared to other proposed bone-suppression models, the ResNet-BS model demonstrated superior performance with the least combined loss (0.0167) and higher values for peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) (34.0678), structural similarity index measure (SSIM) (0.9492), and multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) (0.9828; 95% confidence interval (CI): (0.9022, 1.0)) metrics. However, these values are not statistically significantly different (p > 0.05) across the models. For the classification task, we observed that the bone-suppressed models demonstrated superior values for accuracy (0.95±0.0420), the area under the curve (AUC) (0.9611±0.0440), specificity (1.00), precision (1.00), F-measure (0.9307±0.0615), and MCC (0.9000±0.0842) using the hold-out test data compared to the models trained on the baseline, non-bone-suppressed Montgomery TB dataset. However, no statistically significant difference is observed between the MCC values obtained by the non-bone-suppressed and bone-suppressed models (F(1, 6) = 0.209, p = 0.664). The average AUC obtained by the bone-suppressed models (AUCavg = 0.9500) is superior compared to that obtained by the non-bone-suppressed models (AUCavg = 0.9325). The detection of TB-consistent findings in CXRs improved using the bone-suppressed images, signifying that bone suppression improved the sensitivity of the models toward TB detection and localization.
